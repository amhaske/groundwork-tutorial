Welcome to the groundwork tutorial
==================================

.. warning::

   This tutorial is currently under heavy construction. Updates will be deployed nearly each hour.

   So please come back in 3-4 days, if something is still missing.

This tutorial guides you through the creation of a groundwork based application.

It starts with a simple commandline script for monitoring csv file changes,
adds a database in the second chapter for storing the change history
and finally shows you how to create a complete web application based on the initial script.

This is a bottom-up tutorial and therefore new code and functions are getting added with each new chapter.
If you get lost or your code is not working as expected, try to catch a fresh code base from our git repository at
https://github.com/useblocks/groundwork-tutorial.

If you only want to see the final source code and used architecture,
take a look into :ref:`chapter_n`.

   groundwork is a plugin-based Python Application framework.
