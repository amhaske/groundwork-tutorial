groundwork basics
=================

On the following chapters you will get a short introduction into the idea behind groundwork.
After that we will install groundwork and work with the command ``groundwork``.
This command we will also use to create your first groundwork based python package.
And finally we will extend this package with our first own pattern and plugins.
