Welcome to the groundwork tutorial
==================================

This tutorial guides you through the creation of a groundwork based application.

It starts with a simple commandline script for monitoring csv file changes,
adds a database in the second chapter for storing the change history
and finally shows you how to create a complete web application based on the initial script.

This is a bottom-up tutorial and therefore new code and functions are getting added with each new chapter.
If you get lost and your code is not working as expected, try to catch a fresh code base from our git repository at
https://github.com/useblocks/groundwork-tutorial.

If you only want to see the final source code and used architecture,
take a look into :ref:`chapter_n`.
